The Phone Book Company app

This app is for learning

The app provides convenient access to contact information that’s stored in a SQLite database

on the device. The app can scroll through an alphabetical contact list; view a contact’s details by touching 

a contact’s name in the contact list; add new contacts; edit or delete existing contacts.

Responsibilities:

  Use a RecyclerView to display data from a database

  Use a ContentProvider and a SQLiteDatabase object to interact with data in a SQLite database

  Use a LoaderManager and Loaders to perform database access asynchronously outside the

GUI thread

  Use Cursors to manipulate database query results
